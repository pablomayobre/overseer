An actor can be in multiple states:
Does the actor have a work component? Should the work component exist at all?
The actor should have a queue of... actions? What is an action?
Or just a queue of jobs, and anything outside of that is decided JIT?


Perhaps always running a BT that does deciding for all actors separately?
Choices of the BT:
  - Should we idle?
  - Do the current job?
  - Pick a new job?
  - Shoot / defend
  - Greet people
  - Take breaks
  - Sleep


How should greeting work? Is there an event when two actors get close to each other?
